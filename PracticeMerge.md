# Jammy shortbread

## Ingredients

* 200g hard butter, at room temp
* 100g caster sugar
* 300g plain flour 
* 100g ground almonds  
* Pinch of salt (if using unsalted butter)
* 50g flaked almonds
* Approx 1 jar jam/curd

## Method 

18x28cm traybake tin, greased and lined with baking paper
Preheat oven at 180 degrees (160 fan).

Let the butter soften to room temp first or it'll spray sugar across the room when you try and mix them (or if you're not that organised, just mix the cold butter on its own until it softens, before adding the sugar). 

Put the butter and sugar in a bowl, mix with an electric mixer until combined, then toss in the flour, sugar and ground almonds and mix. It stays quite loose and crumb-y. 
(If you'd rather, you can mix by hand - rub the butter into the dry ingredients like making pastry)

Tip about 3/4 of the mixture into the lined baking tray, squash it down with the back of a wooden spoon . Spread the jam on top evenly  (leave a couple of millimetres border around the edge or it'll bubble up the sides and caramelise).

Add the flaked almonds to the reserved mixture and scatter it on top of the jam. Bake for ~35-45mins (cover with a sheet of baking paper partway if it's getting too brown on top). It doesn't really matter how long you cook it for, there's no egg in there, just depends how you like your shortbread!

Remove from oven, leave to cool in tray for a bit (optionally sprinkle on some caster sugar so it's a bit sparklesy), then transfer to a wire rack, slice and enjoy :)
